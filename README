Unfuddle to Jira Migration



I. Tickets migration
	1. Download the project TicketsMigration and import it.
	2. Request a backup from Unfuddle
	3. Put the file backup.xml (rename it if needed to backup.xml) in the TicketsMigration folder.
	4. Edit the configurations of the project to run it properly:
		The first argument should be either bat or sh (it will become the extensions of the script files) depending on your os.
		The second argument should be the url where you will put your attachment folder from the backup.
	5. Run the project.
	6. Move the renameAttachmentPROJECT file to the attachment folder from your backup and execute the script. 
	7. Upload the attachment folder to the url you entered as second argument.
	8. Import the CSV file on Jira. You can use the CSVConfigurationExample to help you map the fields values of the csv file. 
	9. Go to the TicketsMigration/atlassian folder. Open jira & jira2 .bat or .sh and enter on jira the server, the username and the password of the administrator. On jira2, enter only the server and the password, no username here. For the password, ask all the users that have logged work (time entries on Unfuddle) to choose the same password and enter it here. 
	10. Run either: 
		jira --action run --file actionsPROJECT.txt 
		and 
		timeEntriesPROJECT
	or ./jira.sh --action run --file actionsPROJECT.txt
		and
		./timeEntriesPROJECT.sh
	
II. SVN Repositories Migration
	1. If you are on Microsoft, you may need to download VisualSVN Server. That way, you can run: pathToVisualSVN/vsvnvars in order to run svn commands.
	2. Create a new repository and create as many folders as you have projects (their name should match your projects keys). 
	3. You will then need to load all your svn dumps from your backup into your new repository thanks to this command: 
	type pathToDump/PROJECT.svn.dmp | svnadmin load --parent-dir PROJECT pathToRepository 
	or
	cat pathToDump/PROJECT.svn.dmp | svnadmin load --parent-dir PROJECT pathToRepository 
	***
	4. Once it's done, you can create a new dump file with all these projects that you'll be able to import in Jira:
	svnadmin dump pathToRepository > pathToNewDumpFile/newDump.dump
	5. Upload the dump file into your webdav at this url https://COMPAGNY.atlassian.net/webdav/dump_files/
	See more instructions here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Uploading+Data+via+WebDAV
	6. Go to the SVN Importer and import your dump file.
	7. Create a working copy of your new repository with svn checkout and you're good to go!
